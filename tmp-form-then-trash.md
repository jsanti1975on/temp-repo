# ðŸ”¹ Non-Repudiation Strategy
```Bash
To ensure non-repudiation, we log the following details:

Timestamp (callTime): Logs the date and time of the call.
Caller (Application.UserName) (Optional Enhancement): Captures the Excel username to track who logged the call.
Preventing Unauthorized Changes:
The CallLog sheet can be password-protected to prevent users from modifying call records after entry.
Digital Signatures can be used if needed.
To add a username column:
```


```vba
.Cells(iRow, 6).Value = Application.UserName ' Logs the specialist's username
```
